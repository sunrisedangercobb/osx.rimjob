# osx.rimjob
An app for anytime you feel a rimming is in order.

This is just another wrapper that sits around a .mp3 to play a rimshot sound.  
You can drag and drop into your applications dir and move to your dock.
A little button for when you tell a bad joke and need an extra punch to get the laugh.
